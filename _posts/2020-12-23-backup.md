From time to time it is important to create a backup of your data.
There are some tools that help one to copy files in some sophisticated ways onto a different medium.
I chose [restic](https://restic.net/) for this job.

But this only works well for the data you are working on, we call it *user data*, but not for your configuration.
Some backup articles suggest to just backup the complete users home directory which stores the *user configuration*, but this will not include the *system configuration*.
On top of this for me a backup is not a raw copy of the current system I'm working on, but just the actually relevant data and configuration.
This can also come along with an additional use case for a backup, that I want to use it to setup a clean new system where I only want to take over the data that I actually need.

So far I have not found any system, that covers the aspects mentioned, which leads me to the point that I've started to write down a concept for a [*configuration backup system*]({% link notes/backup.md %}).
You are welcome to send any hints and suggestions.
