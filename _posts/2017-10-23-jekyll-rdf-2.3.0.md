Today we've released #jekyllrdf 2.3.0 at rubygems [https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-rdf](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-rdf).
The [documentation](https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/blob/2.3.0/README.md) & [changelog](https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/blob/2.3.0/CHANGELOG.md) can be found as always at GitHub: [https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/](https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/).
We are very happy about all [contributors](https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/graphs/contributors), from the past and the presence, but would also like to welcome you as a future contributor ;-)
As of today this should be the last version of the 2.x branch, since we are already working hard on the next major release 3.0.0.
If you are interested in what is coming next, have a look at the [3.0.0-milestone](https://github.com/white-gecko/jekyll-rdf/milestone/5).
