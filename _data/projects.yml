  abstract: "OntoWiki is a system for collaborative knowledge management and creation.
It provides different views to the data and can even be extended by plugins, for example a map plugin to provide a geo spacial view to the data.
The underlying data model is a graph database using the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
I like to say, what phpmyadmin is for Relation Databases, is OntoWiki for RDF databases."

- name: DSSN
  subtitle: "Towards a global Distributed Semantic Social Network"
  url: "http://aksw.org/Projects/DSSN"
  abstract: "Online social networking has become one of the most popular services on the Web.
However, current social networks are like walled gardens in which users do not have full control over their data,
are bound to specific usage terms of the social network operator and suffer from a lock-in effect due to the lack of interoperability and
standards compliance between social networks.
A Distributed Semantic Social Network architecture combines vocabularies and protocols such as WebID, FOAF, Semantic Pingback and PubSubHubbub
into a coherent distributed semantic social network, which is capable to provide all crucial functionalities known from centralized social networks."
