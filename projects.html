abstract: "Most of the software I'm using is Open Sourcen and I realy like the idea of Open Source and Free Software.
This is one of the reasons, why I try contribute my part usually under the Terms of the GNU GPL.
The software listed here are mainly scientific prototypes created, where I had a small or a big contribution, but it was never just my work, as it is usual in the scientific and the Open Source community."
