<p>Following our <em>Linked Enterprise Data Services Track</em> at the SEMANTiCS 2016 in Leipzig, we are happy to welcome you to the <em>Workshop on Linked Enterprise Data Services, Provenance, Linking and QualitY</em> (LEDSPLaY) at INFORMATIK 2017 in Chemnitz. After years of research on fundamental questions as well as foundational Linked Data technologies, we noticed that the focus of work now shifts towards the utilization of these technologies in various enterprise scenarios. With our workshop call we have asked for submissions on topics which are relevant for these scenarios. We could compile a program which ranges from micro service management, provenance management, and knowledge extraction and integration to applications which support search and discovery on datasets. Each submission was reviewed by at least three program committee members and we have accepted 7 papers.</p>

<p>This workshop is part of the project <em>LEDS - Linked Enterprise Data Services</em>, which is funded as an <em>Innovative Regional Growth Core in the Area of Leipzig by the German
Federal Ministry of Education and Research</em> (BMBF). Thus we want to thank our enterprise and technology partners eccenca GmbH, brox IT-Solutions GmbH, Ontos GmbH,
Netresearch GmbH & Co. KG and Lecos GmbH as well as our research partners Universität Leipzig and Technische Universität Chemnitz. In addition to that, we want to thank
all the people who helped us by organizing the workshop and by serving as reviewers:
