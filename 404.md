<h2>404 Not Found</h2>

    The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
    not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
    willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not
    indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
    permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the
    origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that
    the condition is likely to be permanent.

(from [RFC7231 section 6.5.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4))
